# Digging_Into-Assembly
This project demonstrates the process of writing a simple C program, generating its corresponding assembly code, and analyzing the assembly code line by line. It serves as an educational resource for understanding how high-level C code translates into low-level assembly instructions, bridging the gap between programming and computer architecture.
